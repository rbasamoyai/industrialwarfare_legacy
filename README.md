A *Minecraft* Forge mod by rbasamoyai that's far from done I suppose.

The mod focuses on NPC workers that make munitions, weapons, and
other stuff. You can then give these products to combat NPCs who
can fight stuff.

### Features currently implemented:
* The mod actually starting up
* An NPC with some brain, can follow instructions and do some basic work
* some cool GUIs
* A simple "workstation" block
* A microcrafting system

### """planned""" features:
* More NPCs
    * NPCs actually doing something
    * NPC Combat
* Generated structures with NPCs
* Research trees
* Some ores
* Weapons

### Currently working on (or not)
* Diplomacy

hey, if you notice that I used discord's image hosting for this, zip it, as I can't be bothered to put this somewhere else, mmkay?
will probably put it on somewhere like imgur later on but for now deal with it :trol:

A *Minecraft* Forge mod by rbasamoyai that's far from done I suppose.

The mod focuses on NPC workers that make munitions, weapons, and
other stuff. You can then give these products to combat NPCs who
can fight stuff.

---

### Features currently implemented:
* The mod actually starting up
* An NPC with some brain, can follow instructions
* some cool GUIs
* A simple "workstation" block
* A microcrafting system

### """planned""" features:
* More NPCs
    * NPC occupations
    * NPCs actually doing something
    * Combat NPCs
* Generated structures and NPCs
* Research trees
* Some ores
* Weapons

### Currently working on (or not)
* Basic NPC AI
    * Complaints system so you can figure out why stuff isnt working
